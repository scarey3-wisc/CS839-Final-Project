# CS839-Final-Project
Contains screenshots, .usda files, the readme, the write up, the code, and the build tree for Stephen Carey's final project for CS 839, Physics Based Modelling. The goal was to write an isosurface stuffing algorithm that would generated a tetrahedral mesh from a signed distance function representation of an object and use earlier CS 839 simulation code to drop that object on the ground. Simulations were saved as .usda files, which can be viewed with USDView software.

See  ProjectReport.pdf for details about technical challenges and sample screenshots.

See the Screenshots Folder for a larger sample of screenshots

See Example USDA File folder for the actual simulations

See tests/Mesh for the code.
